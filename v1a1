< WHEN IS THI ? >

THI is now. By definition. We choose to step up, or not. I chose to step up, and I continue to do so to this day. 

By timing everything, and especially the important things, We will begin to see the world in terms of time that matters. By treating only things that matter, we will begin to see patterns in the way we think about time. Beyond the third derivative quantity of jerk, we have only vague notions of choice and will. Of the time-derivative quantities, it will become that the fourth and fifth quantities are what matter. Until then, I choose to focus on jerk, and choice ( higher order time derivative quantities. ) Whoah, ramble town.
